# Classifier

This code base is a "JUNK" and a "Hack" developed in 3 Days (15hrs/day). The way application has been coded is not my usual style. It was created to demonstrate capabilities of Data Mining using VB.net in the year 2010.

"Classification using Supervised learning" was in its developing stage during these years or we can say - "was not pervasive". Statisticians who new mathematical techniques had to struggle to put these concepts into "machine's mnemonic format". Also , we can say that computers were not strong enough to process the amount of information to show usability in any practical applications. People adopted python more rapidly than other complex programming languages (langauges that gave more independence to tweak space and time taken by an app).

This implementation was just a hacking excercise to demonstrate that classification can be done using visual basic as well. It was quite interesting to see that algorithms such as "porter stemmer" were available online as independent source files. Using it and other intricate mathematical operations and documents, I was able to develope a tool that can be trained on various kinds of text files and then classify similar kinds of them into labels(response variable).

This code can serve as a piece of scratch to work on, if someone wants to develope a Classifier in .Net.

Enjoy Coding !!!
